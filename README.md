# Stackline Take Home Project
 
The purpose of this project was to create a simple web page using React and Redux and implement the following:
- A solution that resembles the provided mockup closely and
implements AT LEAST ONE of either the graph or table as
seen in the mockup
- A working solution that takes the provided JSON file as output
from a mock API call
- A solution that implements React and Redux best practices and patterns
- Clean, easy to follow code

## Extra Features

I added sorting functionality to the table. By clicking on any of the columns you can sort it by descending or ascending values.

## Possible Improvements

There are plenty of things that could be added to this that would improve the page. The page could be made responsive by adjusting the component sizes for smaller screens as well as placing the side bar and table components in a column rather than side by side. It would also benefit from having a search bar that would allow users to search for different products that exist as well as testing for the UI and functionality. This is not an exhaustive list of all improvements, and I would love to get some feedback on where I could have done better!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
